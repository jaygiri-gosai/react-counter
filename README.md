# react-counter

Creating a simple counter using React which increments or decrements count dynamically on-screen as the user clicks on the button. This exercise requires knowledge of fundamental React concepts such as State, Component, etc.

We can complete the simple counter exercise with the following steps:

1. Create React state to store the count value.
2. Declare JS functions to incement or decrement the value through setState().
3. Add HTML buttons with onClick to JSX code.
